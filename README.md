# Weenix
Weenix operating system is a project for people interested in writing parts of a Unix kernel. The operating system was originally written in 1998 by teaching assistants for Brown Universityâ€™s operating systems course taught by Professor Tom Doeppner. Our team finished this project when taking the Operating Systems course at University of Southern California in Spring 2017.
