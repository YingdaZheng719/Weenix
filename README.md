# Weenix
Weenix operating system is a project for people interested in writing parts of a Unix kernel. The operating system was originally written in 1998 by teaching assistants for Brown Universityâ€™s operating systems course taught by Professor Tom Doeppner. While the operating system is mostly based on early versions of Unix, it incorporates many recent developments in operating systems. 

Refer to the weenix documentation for more details of this project.
